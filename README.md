This plugin changes the default registration form; creates a user role, Job Seeker; and redirects that user to the job alerts page upon login.

== Description ==

This is a plugin to accompany the WP Jobs Manager and the WP Job Manager Alerts plugin. Once activated, it creates a new user role, Job Seeker and sets it as the default role for registrations. The plugin also adds two new fields to the registration form - first and last name - and makes them a requirement for registration. Thirdly, this plugin redirects Job Seekers upon login to the job alerts dashboard page instead of the dashboard. This plugin creates two shortcodes [loggedin][/loggedin] and [loggedout][/loggedout].

== Installation ==

e.g.
